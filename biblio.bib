	abstract = {In an earlier paper it was suggested that a knowledge of the elastic-stress variation in the neighborhood of an angular corner of an infinite plate would perhaps be of value in analyzing the stress distribution at the base of a V-notch. As a part of a more general study, the specific case of a zero-angle notch, or crack, was carried out to supplement results obtained by other investigators. This paper includes remarks upon the antisymmetric, as well as symmetric, stress distribution, and the circumferential distribution of distortion strain-energy density. For the case of a symmetrical loading about the crack, it is shown that the energy density is not a maximum along the direction of the crack but is one third higher at an angle {\textpm} cos-1 (1/3); i.e., approximately {\textpm}70 deg. It is shown that at the base of the crack in the direction of its prolongation, the principal stresses are equal, thus tending toward a state of (two-dimensional) hydrostatic tension. As the distance from the point of the crack increases, the distortion strain energy increases, suggesting the possibility of yielding ahead of the crack as well as {\textpm}70 deg to the sides. The maximum principal tension stress occurs on {\textpm}60 deg rays. For the antisymmetrical stress distribution the distortion strain energy is a relative maximum along the crack and 60 per cent lower {\textpm} 85 deg to the sides.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},
